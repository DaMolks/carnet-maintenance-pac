# Server

This directory contains a simple Express server for the project.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server (defaults to port 3001):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to verify the server is running.

You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable before starting the server.
